# Ruby Predictive Solitaire Card Game

### Was summer ..
**A little story (you can skip it!)**
Was August, 2015 and I was in [Calabria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabria), relaxing and preparing my new season as *eager-to-learn-young-programmer*. Was late evening, maybe 11:30 PM, and I was in a little bar in [Guardavalle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardavalle), where my Mum, my Grandma, my Grandfa, my Uncles.... and a lot of my parents was born :) I wasn't yet tired to go sleep, and I wanted to spend some other minutes there. With me there was on my table a deck of cards, [italian suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_card#Italian_suits) of course.

Thinking about card games, a strange old solitaire game cames to my mind. I some terms a *stupid* solitaire game. Indeed, in this game, there is no ability. You don't need a lot attenction, you don't need to be very awake. Everything in this game is **predictive** and everything depends on the inital position of cards. Even a kid could do it. It is made just for spending time.

Afther a few games with these premises, I relized that, given the initial position of the cards and an appropiate algorithm, we can predice the game outcome in a flash. It's a function! *f(cards) -> boolean outcome*. Maybe I could try to do this as a Kata.. why not. Maybe in Ruby, a programming language I don't know how I'd like to know. I'll do it in the next days during my spare times!

That's it.
